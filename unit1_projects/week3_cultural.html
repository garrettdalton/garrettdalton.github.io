  		<!--<h1> </h1>-->
  		  <p>After taking the quiz on learning styles, I found out that my learning style is abstract random.  According to the test itself:"Abstract Random thinkers organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments."</p>
  		  <p>To sum up AR style learners, they are people oriented, and focus on the issues at hand.  They learn well in a personal environment with broad guidlines and work well in group settings.</p>
        <p>At first I was somewhat skeptical about whether or not AR style fit for me.  After reading about the other styles however, I think it might be pretty accurate.  This week at DBC I did a lot of peer pairing, and while it was a new and somewhat nervous experience, I think I actually learned a bit faster with someone to bounce Ideas off of.  I think that I should definitely strive to peer pair more often, and attempt to interpret the challenges a little more loosely, while staying within the guidelines.</p>
        <p>My biggest struggle so far with phase 0 has been time management.  This week I did much better, but my first two weeks I found myself underestimating the amount of time I would need for the challenges.  Ar thinkers have difficulty concentrating on one thing at a time.  While I have not only had some issues with procrastinating. I often have difficulty starting a challenge, as I tend to think of the big picture instead of focusing on the tiny details.  Know I am AR, I hope to develope the ability to focus in on the smaller details in order to get the project going.  This week I found pseudocoding to be a very helpful exercise in order to focus my attention on one thing, and then start to look at the bigger picture.</p>
        <p>To grow my mindset, I would like to experiment with different learning style strengths (such as analyzing situations before making a decision and acting from abstract sequential style) in order to broaden my strengths in learning.  I will try to remember to keep my environment abstract random by working with others, and focusing on the issues at hand.  In doing this, I think I can keepy myself in a comfortable learning environment, while experimenting with techniques in order to approach the challenges differently.</p>
