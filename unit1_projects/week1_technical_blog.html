        <h1> My 3 Favorite Websites</h1>
  		    <p>Todays blog post will be my anaylsis of 3 websites which I frequently use while spending time on the internet.</p>
        <h2>
          <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>
        </h2>
          <p> <img src="https://github.com/garrettdalton/garrettdalton.github.io/blob/master/unit1_projects/images/googlehome.png?raw=true" height="30%" width="30%"> </p>
  		    <p>   By far one of my most used sites, Google also happens to be my homepage address.  In my opinion, search engines are one of if not the most powerful tool available on the internet, giving you near limitless ability to seek information.  I prefer Google mainly because I adopted it when I began using the internet as a kid.  </p>
          <p>     The webpage design for google is extremely minimalistic.  The all white background is contrasted by the colorful logo which draws the user directly to the search bar, which is the main purpose of the page. The page is somewhat funny, as by itself it is almost completely lacking in content, but the search function will bombard you with as much content as a person could ask for.  The site isn't all that attention grabbing, nor does it retain my interest for very long, but its usefullness keeps users coming back again and again. </p>
          <p>     While the site doesn't necessarily sell a product, it certainly sells a brand.  The only options available aside from searching are links to gmail and google+, which are other web apps developed by google to compete with other companies. </p>
          <p>  To sum the site up in five words: </p>  
           <ul>
             <li>easy</li>
             <li>useful</li>
             <li>minimalistic</li>
             <li>fast</li>
             <li>friendly</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>
          <a href="http://www.reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a>
        </h2>
          <p> <img src="https://github.com/garrettdalton/garrettdalton.github.io/blob/master/unit1_projects/images/reddithome.png?raw=true" height="30%" width="30%"> </p>
          <p>    My most used site for time-wasting, Reddit is an interesting mix of user generated comment ranging from informative to nonsensical and everything in between.  I check this site out to relax, laugh, and gain tidbits of information here and there.  Useful if you have some time to kill. </p>
          <p>    The main page itself is a bit of a mess, but the small thumbnail images to the left of the main page definitely catch your eye and draw you in.  Certain topics don't show/require a thumbnail and are easily overlooked.  The thumbnails are definitely useful for those with short attention spans.  The rest of the page is covered in both text and links, which is overwhelming at first, but for those who register (I haven't personally) can be customized to direct only wanted information and topics.  The main page is easy enough to browse through, though the process to get into more specific topics is daunting.  The header bar is probably the best designed part of the page, with quick links to the most popular (or your customized) subsections. </p>
          <p>     Reddit isn't trying to sell you much merchandize, but rather sell you on it's community.  The front page has a sidebar of different signups and searches in order to entice users into joining and exploring more subsections. </p>
          <p> To sum up the site in five words: </p>
           <ul>
             <li>cluttered</li>
             <li>varied</li>
             <li>vast</li>
             <li>funny</li>
             <li>opinionated</li>
           </ul>
