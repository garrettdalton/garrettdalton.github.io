        <h1> My 3 Favorite Websites</h1>
  		    <p>Todays blog post will be my anaylsis of 3 websites which I frequently use while spending time on the internet.</p>
        <h2>
          <a href-"https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>
        </h2>

  		    <p>   By far one of my most used sites, Google also happens to be my homepage address.  In my opinion, search engines are one of if not the most powerful tool available on the internet, giving you near limitless ability to seek information.  I prefer Google mainly because I adopted it when I began using the internet as a kid.  </p>
          <p>     The webpage design for google is extremely minimalistic.  The all white background is contrasted by the colorful logo which draws the user directly to the search bar, which is the main purpose of the page. The page is somewhat funny, as by itself it is almost completely lacking in content, but the search function will bombard you with as much content as a person could ask for.  The site isn't all that attention grabbing, nor does it retain my interest for very long, but its usefullness keeps users coming back again and again. </p>
          <p>     While the site doesn't necessarily sell a product, it certainly sells a brand.  The only options available aside from searching are links to gmail and google+, which are other web apps developed by google to compete with other companies. </p>
          <p>  To sum the site up in 5 words: </pp>  
           <ul>
             <li>easy</li>
             <li>useful</li>
             <li>minimalistic</li>
             <li>fast</li>
             <li>friendly</li>
            </ul>
