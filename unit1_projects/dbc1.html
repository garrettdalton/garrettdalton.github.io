  	<h1><strong>Hello!</strong> My name is Garrett Dalton</h1>

  	<h2>This is my first web page for DBC</h2>

  	<h3>I am extremely excited to be learning html!</h3>

  	<h4>I <em>do</em> have some experience with programming, as I have studied computer science</h4>

  	

  	<h5>Here is some information about me!</h5>
  	  <p class="twos">I am a full time student, while working as a bartender on weekends.  I have studied 3 years of sociology, but am now studying computer science. Most of my experience is in c++.</p>
  	  <p id="ones">I currently live with my girlfriend Kristin in Tuckahoe, NY.  We have 2 adopted cats name Jax and Scout.  One day soon I hope to ask her to marry me!</p>
  	  <p class="twos">My hobbies include playing video games, tinkering with drink recipes, reading, and running!  I love to sit outside on a nice day with a cold beer.  If you ever want to come play video games I have a pretty sizeable collection.  Thanks for taking time to read about me!</p>

  	<h6>I hope you enjoy my site!</h6>
