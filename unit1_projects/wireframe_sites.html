	<h1>Google</h1>
	  <p> The main challenge on the Google page is getting the user to access the search bar as easy as possible.  The web page solves this by making the page as simple as possible, and pushing other options to the corners without much flare.</p>

	 <h1>Reddit</h1>
	 <p> The main challenge on Reddit is providing a tremendous amout of coverage for the user data stored on the site.  The front page communicates a sampling of the most popular posts, while also offering links at the top of the page for popular subsections.  The pictures are the biggest draw for users, as they convey a small snapshop of the post while encouraging further investigating.  The right side also has big images, to draw users into the reddit community with a search function and singup/login.</p>

	 <h1>Kotaku<h1>
	 <p> The main problem that the Kotaku site is solving is getting users interested in articles, while presenting as much material as possible to rope the user in.  This is accomplished with a combination of heavy image use (the hook of the article), bold titles, and furthermore squishing as much into the space as possible while still remaining neat.  The challenge is to draw the users to the articles.  Kotaku not only allows a slower pace broesing scroll through them, but a sidebar allows for quick browsing through popular links.  They also have minimal buttons and links to avoid distracting from the articles.</p>
