        So what makes Javascript so good?
       </h1>
  		  <p>There are numerous reason as to why Javascript is widely used.  Originally javascript was written to add some limited programmability to web pages, it has since grown and expanded to dominate the web.</p>
  		  <p>Some of the reasons for the widespread application of javascript on the web include:
          <ul>
            <li><em>It is easy to learn, fast and powerful.</em>Javascript works client side, so applying it to a website takes no server requests, and is as simple as adding it to a webpage and refreshing the page.  Also, it utilizes and object oriented structure which makes it very useful for the programmer.</li>
            <li><em>Javascript runs on a massive amount of browsers.</em> Most people who use a browser to access the internet use one that works with javascript.  It works on so many versions of so many browsers that using it on your dynamic web page means it will work for the majority of users. </li>
            <li><em>It reduces load on the server.</em>  Javascript allows for many of what was previously a back and forth between the server and client sides to be handled without the server.  Thus allowing the server to handle things more important than html. </li>
            </ul></p>

      <h1> And the cons? </h1>
      <p> While Javascript may seem to be the best language ever, there are a few reasons for which it cannot be labeled as 'perfect':</p>
      <p><ul>
        <li><em>Security.</em> Because Javascript is client-side, it executes immediatley on the useres computer.  Malicious software can be added to users computers due to the immediateness of the code executing.</li>
        <li><em>Javascript is read differently by some browsers.</em> This requires that Javascript webpages be tested on multiple browsers to assure there is no weird things happening to the code and webpage.</li>
          </ul>
