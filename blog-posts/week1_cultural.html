  		  <p>So far my experience with DBC has been both exciting, exhausting, and mind changing.  Week one came at me at a really busy time during finals week, and has left me exhausted.  I actually think it was a good learning experience as I got to work through a little mini crunch before experiencing the everyday fast pace at on site.  I don't think I have ever learned so much in such a short period of time.</p>
        <p>The video itself has relieved me of some nervousness, as I was definitely worried as to whether or not I would be under the curve coming into DBC. Shereef was very reassuring when he said everybody is at the 0.1% of mastering software engineering.  His description of the attitude and work ethic is what I sort of expected from what I read about DBC as well as my experience with the interview and prep phase.  The only expectations that have changed for me are my expectations of myself!  I have always loved learning, but have been somewhat unmotivated putting What I have learned to use.  This past day and a half I think I have proved to myself that I can accomplish everything I want to if I just put my mind to it.</p>
        <p> I really cannot wait to set foot into DBC during phase 1.  While I am somewhat nervous, I know that if I work at it I can really expand my skillset and become not only a better programmer but hopefully a better person.  </p>
