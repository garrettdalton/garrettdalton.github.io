  		<h1>What is DRM?</h1>
  		  <p>DRM stands for digital rights management, which is a class of technologies that are used by hardware manufacturers, publishers, copyright holders, and individuals with the intent to control the use of digital content and devices are sale.  To put it simpler: DRM attempts to give control to the seller after the product has been given to the consumer.  It is often used to prevent the copying and distribution of software, but is also used in video games to prevent cheating and accessing the source code, different hardware devices such as phones to prevent unlimited use of the device. The method behind DRM varies greatly, and is extremely widespread in the tech industry.</p>
        <h1>So what is wrong with DRM?</h1>
  		  <p>DRM in tech is most often used to prevent piracy of software, or in hardware to prevent using unintended software.  The downside to DRM, is that as a consumer, you are receiving a product which you are restricted in its use.  Oftentimes DRM on software actually has terms in it which state that you are renting the software, and do not actually own the software itself.  DRM takes the power of the consumer, and puts them fully at the mercy of the seller.  Not only does DRM take away the full capabilities of a product, but it can be incovenient as well (e.g. having to be always online for a single player game, being unable to copy music to your computer more than a certain amount of times, being unable to use software on your phone that belongs to a competitor).  Even worse, most DRM can be worked around, and in turn, pirates and hackers can access the product without the DRM restrictions, and legitimate buyers are left with a frustrating, restrictive product.</p>
