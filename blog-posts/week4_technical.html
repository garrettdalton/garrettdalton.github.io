  		<h1> So what is #map? </h1>
  		  <p>#map is a predetermined method which can be called with any enumerator.  Map will return a new array with the results of running the given block once for each element which it was called on.</p>
  		  <p>As an example, say you had an array of integers called my_ints, and you wished to add 2 to every int in that array. If my_ints = [1, 2, 3] then you could do so using #map: my_ints.map {|x| x + 1}. This would return an array equal to [2,3,4]
        </p>
      <h1>#map vs. #map!</h1>
        <p>Now in the above example you get to return an array of modified ints, but what if you wanted to make changes to the array my_ints?  calling my_ints.map! will call the destructive version of #map, which will modify the original array it is called on.  In this case, calling my_ints.map! {|x| x + 1} would modify my_ints to equal [2, 3, 4]</p>
