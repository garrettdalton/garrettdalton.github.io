  		<h1>What rings true for me?</h1>
  		  <p><em>Compassion, Enthusiasm, Growth, Openness, Personal development.</em>  These were the values that jumped out at me when I scanned through the big list.  I felt that was the best way to pick some, so I went through once and wrote down each that seemed to resonate with me.</p>
        <p>  The most important of those that I chose I think would be compassion.  Within the past few years or so, as I have matured and learned about myself, I have found that having compassion for others is one of the most powerful and important feelings I can have in my everyday life.  I have found that if I take a moment to think about other people in moments of stress, anger, sadness, and even happiness or excitement, it helps shape my view of the world in a much better way.  Realizing that every person on the planet has their own story, their own narrative day in and day out, and that each person is just as important as you are will help make every day for you and everyone around you a little bit better.</p>
  		  <p>I would say that for most of those values I would give myself a 4 out of 5 as far as trying to live up to them.  I definitely try to think and craft my daily interaction with values like these in mind, but I know that on certain days it just becomes so hard to stick to doing the right thing.</p>
      <h1>Stereotype threat and compassion</h1>
      <p>I think that having compassion for people will absolutely be helpful in nullifying stereotype threat.  Trying to put myself into others shoes, and realizing that they are in the same boat as me when coming to DBC will help me try to make myself a member of the DBC community, and welcome all others.  I think that compassion is key for breaking down barriers put up by stereotypes.</p>
      <p>If I ever feel sad or down at DBC, I think taking a break and calling my girlfriend would be my first approach to cheering up.  I love her so much and just talking to her helps me destress and realize that problems can sometimes seem massive but can always be overcome.</p>
