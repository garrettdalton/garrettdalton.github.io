  		  <p>In my experience as a bartender, I would say that I experienced emotional conflict almost every time I would work a night behind the bar.  Bartending, as I'm sure any position in the service industry, is internally very emotionally stressful.  In order to be a good bartender, it is key that you keep an outwardly kind, calm, and agreeable demeanor.  This is often internally conflicting with how you might actually feel about what is currently going on at the bar.</p>
        <p>While there were many times where I was internally conflicted, there were also times where conflict arouse between me and a patron at the bar.  While I consider myself an emotionally in control person, and during my bartending I have learned to keep a calm command of myself in emotionally evocative situations, there have been a few times where I found myself unable to supress my emotional feelings.</p>
        <p>Interestingly enough, I feel like it is a necessity to practice avoidance during bartending.  My emotional state at my job directly  impacted the amount of money I made. Having disagreements with the patrons, or even showing any emotion other than calm and confident would negatively effect my income for the night.</p>
        <p>I can think of one instance in particular where I couldn't control my feeling of anger during a disagreement I had with two patrons.  The way I remember the conflict arising is from a disagreement with how the couple felt I had handled the food bill.  As the two were preparing to leave, I kindly reminded them that I had their bill for the food they had ordered, and asked if they wanted me to fetch it for them.  This unfortunately did not sit well with the couple.</p>
        <p>The couple were upset that I had not given them the bill immediatly after they had finished with the food (to clarify they had cash on the bar which they were paying for drinks before and after ordering and eating the food, but since food is sent to the kitchen through the computer I have to settle it in a different register).  One of the two patrons explained this to me, to which I responeded that I was sorry I had not given them the bill earlier, but I felt it would be rude of me to give the bill without them asking for it.  I was very calm and apologetic at this point, as during bartender small issues arise from people's preferences all that time.  Unfortunately the conflict began to get out of hand, as one of the two from the couple began to accuse me of "helping myself to my tip already from their money".</p>
        <p>At this point I was internally furious, as I had just been accused of stealing.  I tried to reassure the couple that I had never stolen anything from a bar patron and I was sorry if I had given them the impression that I was attempting to trick them.</p>
        <p>Things got worse.  The couple were becoming very agitated, and my attempts to diffuse the situation weren't working.  It was at this point that one of the two began to accuse the restaurant I work at (which is owned by my family) of ripping people off.  Not only that, but the two then proceeded to warn the people in the bar whom they knew that they were leaving and the other people should not only leave, but not tip me any money.</p>
        <p>I couldn't take it anymore.  I would be fine with them leaving, and I have had people not leave a tip before, but I was so angry that they were telling other patrons (many of whom are regulars) what in my opinion were blatant lies.  I lost my temper, and raised my voice, and while I didn't flip out or anything, I was definitely visibly furious.  I refused to speak to the couple other than to tell them my name, (they had been calling me by another bartender's name) which I nearly shouted at them.</p>
        <p>I am aware this might have been a warranted response.  But my actions only made the situation worse.  The couple stormed out after a few more remarks to other patrons, and me allowing my emotions to overcome my proffesionalism only gave their claims some weight.  While I certainly tried my best, if I could go back I think I would attempt to end the conversation earlier, and do nothing more than apologize and keep my feelings to myself.  Attempting to correct them on what had happened only fed their anger, and in turn escalted the conflict.</p>
        <p>That being said, I think the way I reacted wasn't entirely uncalled for.  They were really being unnnecessarily confrontational, but my through my experience with bartending I should have known better than to disagree with an angry patron.  I think looking back at this experience has taught me that even when you think you are in total control of your emotions, it is possible to be overwhelmed by them.  The key to settling the emotional conflict is to quickly identify the situation before it gets out of hand.</p>
