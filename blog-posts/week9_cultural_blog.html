  		  <p>Most of the questions I have been asking during phase 0 have been during guided and peer pairing sessions.  The questions I have posted to the community have for the most part been simple, straightforward, and easy to answer, so there isn't too much to say about those.  What I will say, is that while these were generally easy questions and I just was missing something, they actually were good questions because they were straightforward.</p>
  		  <p>I think the key to asking a good quesiton is to make it to the point.  Questions need to have a focus, and while they can be broad, you don't want to ask several vague things in one single question.  Using the strategy of looking at your question and approaching it as if you were trying to answer it should help here.  It is difficult to approach several different subjects/thoughts in one go, so focus and direct your question so that it can be understood, and answered concisely.</p>
        <p>I would say after looking at the stack overflow guidelines I will definitely think to make my title as sucinct as possible.  This is probably more so that people won't pass by your question for being too big, but definitely makes the question approachable and simple to understand, similar to how essays have a thesis.  Also, I will be sure to include snippets of my code when appropriate, as including some context can be very useful for the person looking to help.</p>
