  		<h1>Stereotype Threat and Me</h1>
  		  <p>Stereotype threat is a concept I know very well.  I studied three years of college level sociology and it was a big concept in many of the things I learned during that time.  I don't think I have personally felt it on any sort of major level as I am not really belonging to any stereotyped groups as I am white, middle-class, and caucasian, and of medium attributes. I have certainly felt anxious in situations where I feel I am an outsider, but not really because of negative stereotypes.</p>
  		  <p>That being said, I certainly can imagine (and have done research for school) on many situations in which someone could feel such a threat.  If I find myself or suspect someone else of feeling this way in a situation in the future I have read about a few ways to make it have less of an impact.</p>
        <p>The first way seems obvious to me, though not all that easy.  Not reinforcing, giving credit to, and believing in negative stereotypes is without a doubt the most important step.  If every person in the world did this, then stereotypes would cease to exist.  Because of my sociological background, I have changed my viewpoints on stereotypes and am now aware that they are almost always not true. Sweeping generalizations are just a way for people to lump things that are different than them into one big pile.  Though I know I still feel bias and new situations can be scary for me, I think that understanding that stereotypes are unfair, not factual, and often made up is the first step in helping rid my environment of stereotype threat.</p>
        <p>Another way to fight back is to encourage and reaffirm good effort and behavior in not only myself but others in my environment.  This affirmation will help people overcome any sort of stereotype threat, and thus dissipate anxiety they might feelin the situation.</p>
        <p>Lastly, making others feel like a part of a community, and becoming a part of that community myself, will further disallow steretypes to come into play.  If everyone feels like they are fully welcome in the group, then it will be harder for them to feel steretyped against.</p>
