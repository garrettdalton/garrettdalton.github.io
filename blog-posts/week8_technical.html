  		  <p>Sorting algorithms are used in programming to order a list (often stored in an array to allow random access) of items.  Most often they are sorted numerically or alphabetically.  There are many different algorithms for sorting, which differ in the ways that they approach the sorting of the items.  The following are a few of the most popular sorts.</p>
  		  <h1>Bubble Sort</h1>
        <p>The bubble sort is one of the most simple sorting algorithms.  It steps through the list of items, compares the adjacent items, and swaps them if they are wrongly ordered.  This process repeats until no more swaps are necessary, thus leaving a sorted list.  Each iteration will check one less item on the list as the last item will be positioned correctly from the previous pass.</p>
        <h1>Quicksort</h1>
        <p>The quick sort is different from the bubble sort in that it uses a divide and conquer algorithm.  The list is first divided into two smaller sub-array: low elements and high elements and then recursively sorts the subarrays into smaller and smaller sub-arrays until the list is sorted.  It does this by using a pivot element to split the list into elements higher than and lower than the sub element.  Those sub arrays then are sorted by their own pivot until there can be no more sorting.</p>
        <h1>Merge Sort</h1>
        <p>The merge sort is also a divide and conquer style algorithm.  It works by first dividing the list into sub arrays of the smallest unit available (1 element).  Then the merge compares the adjacent sub arrays and merge those subarrays into bigger lists to produce larger sorted sub arrays.  This repeats until there is one array remaining.</p>
