  		<h1>Pairing in Phase 0</h1>
  		  <p>To be frank, when I initially read on the DBC guidelines that we would be peer pairing every week for the entirety of phase 0 I was not happy.  Not only was I worried about having to interact over video chat (which I had rarely done before.  But I was worried about being able to complete work in a pair.  After about 4 weeks of experiencing it though, I would say that my perception of working as a team has changed.  Not only have I enjoyed communicating with and getting to know some of my peers, but I believe each person of the pair has benefitted greatly by participating in peer pairing.  Having another person to bounce ideas off of, having another pair of eyes to catch mistakes, having another mind to approach challenges and problems, and most of all having someone who is in the same boat as you is an enormous resource.  I never thought I would say it, but I look forward to grouping on challenges every week, and love that I can do so with relative ease.</p>
  		  <p>Specifically, I have enjoyed getting to know every person that I have paired with.  It is nice to know that every single person shares similar fears about DBC, and shares a similar motivation to suceed.  At times I will admit that I have felt frustrated when trying to explain a concept to a peer, or when they seem to get somethign that I don't.  Looking back however, I have realized that when I am forced to make my explanations more clear, and make myself demonstrate in a better way the concept, it has helped me craft my ability to communicate.  Though it may take more time, I am benfitting and exanding upon my skillset in doing so.  Whether they are teaching me, or I them, it is a worthwhile effort.</p>
  		  <h1>Feedback</h1>
  		  <p>Reading my feedback was an interesting experience.  I went into it feeling defensive and worried.  I was hoping for good things, and worried that people wouldn't be happy with pairing with me.  I was relieved to find that for the most part people enjoyed pairing with me.  I realize now that I actually crave suggestions for how I can be better, as I can then hone my communication and ability to pair up.  </p>
  		  <p>So far I don't have too many feedbacks, and the actionable suggestions are a bit limited so I hope people will offer more advice in the future.  The one thing I will focus on is being more confident in my ideas and expressing them with more assertiveness (which was some feedback I received).  I do realize that I often suggest and hint at things instead of stating them, so I should be more confident when expressing an idea.</p>
  		  <p>Writing feedback has been somewhat tricky for me.  I myself want people to be brutally honest, and amongst my best friends I will tell them if something is bothering me or if I have a suggestion for them.  Giving my fellow DBCers advice is trickier for me however, as I am not sure if we are quite on that level of friendship.  I do think that I can adjust this by making sure my suggestions are completely in the ASK guidlines.  I myself would love more constructive feedback, so I should offer it out to others.</p>
  		  <p>I do think that this blog has actually made me realize that I need to think more deeply about the growth midset learning.  I think I now realize that the peer pairing is not only useful for completing the challenges.  But to build our communication skillset.  Here's to more pairing in the future!</p>
